# analysis_template

This repo provides a template repo for doing data analysis.

The philosophy of the template is based on three parts.

1. Access

Gaining access to the data, including overcoming availability challenges (data is distributed across architectures, called from an obscure API, written in log books) as well as legal rights (for example intellectual property rights) and individual privacy rights (such as those provided by the GDPR).

2. Assess

Understanding what is in the data. Is it what it's purported to be, how are missing values encoded, what are the outliers, what does each variable represent and how is it encoded.

3. Process

Translating the data in to a specific insight by, for example, answering a question with the data.
