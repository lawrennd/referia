# CIP-0002: Refactoring Compute Class Inheritance Structure

## Summary
This proposal outlines a plan to refactor the inheritance structure of the Compute class to eliminate commented-out code that was migrated to the lynguine dependency, improving code clarity and maintainability.

## Motivation
The current implementation of the `referia.assess.compute.Compute` class inherits from `lynguine.assess.compute.Compute` but contains commented-out methods that are outdated versions of functionality now implemented in lynguine. This creates confusion for developers and makes maintenance harder. A clean inheritance structure would make the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand.

## Detailed Description
The `referia.assess.compute.Compute` class currently has commented-out implementations of several methods, including `run_all` and `run`. Investigation confirms that these methods represent historical implementations that have been migrated to the `lynguine` package with updated method signatures. This creates several issues:

1. It's unclear to developers which implementation is current
2. The comments don't explain that the code was migrated to lynguine
3. Method signatures have changed between the commented code and current lynguine implementations
4. There is potential for confusion when updating either the parent or child classes

### Specific Examples
In `referia/assess/compute.py`, we see:

```python
# def run_all(self, data : "CustomDataFrame", pre : bool=False, post : bool=False) -> None:
```

While the current implementation in lynguine has the signature:

```python
def run_all(self, data : "CustomDataFrame", interface : Interface) -> None:
```

This change in signature explains the test failure noted in the workspace file: "test_run_all in referia/tests/test_assess_compute.py was failing because the run_all method in lynguine.assess.compute.Compute requires an 'interface' parameter that wasn't being passed in the test."

## Implementation Plan

1. **Remove Commented-out Code**:
   - Remove all commented-out method implementations that have been migrated to lynguine
   - Add clear comments explaining which methods are inherited from lynguine
   - Document any differences in method signatures between old and new implementations

2. **Add Migration Notes**:
   - Add a section in the class docstring explaining the migration to lynguine
   - Document which functionality now lives in lynguine vs. referia

3. **Update Method Overrides**:
   - Ensure any overridden methods in referia match the signature of parent methods in lynguine
   - Add clear docstrings to overridden methods explaining what functionality is being extended

4. **Standardize Testing**:
   - Update all tests to use the current method signatures
   - Add tests that verify the inheritance is working correctly

## Backward Compatibility
This refactoring should have no impact on external interfaces as it only removes commented-out code that is not in use. The referia package already depends on the lynguine package with the current implementations.

## Testing Strategy
- Ensure all existing tests pass after the refactoring
- Add specific tests that verify the inheritance relationship works correctly
- Document test cases for methods that have changed signatures

## Implementation Status
- [x] Remove commented-out code
- [x] Add migration notes to class docstrings
- [x] Update method overrides to match parent signatures
- [x] Standardize testing
- [x] Document the inheritance structure
