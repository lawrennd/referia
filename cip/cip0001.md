# CIP-0001: Standardization of Test Methods for Compute Class

## Summary

This code improvement proposal outlines a standardized approach for testing the Compute class methods across the referia codebase, focusing on improving test reliability and ensuring proper parameter validation with the parent lynguine implementation.

## Motivation

The current implementation of test methods for the Compute class contains inconsistencies in how parameters are passed, leading to test failures. Specifically, the `test_run_all` method in `referia/tests/test_assess_compute.py` is failing because the parent `run_all` method in `lynguine.assess.compute.Compute` requires an `interface` parameter that isn't being properly handled in the test. This inconsistency stems from method signature changes that occurred when functionality was migrated from referia to lynguine.

## Detailed Description

The issue is found in the test suite, specifically in `test_run_all` in `referia/tests/test_assess_compute.py`, which calls `compute_instance.run_all(mock_data, mock_interface)` but doesn't properly assert the expected behavior. Additionally, the test doesn't reflect understanding of the inheritance structure where the actual implementation exists in the lynguine package.

Our investigation revealed that the `run_all` method signature changed during migration:
- Old (commented-out) referia: `run_all(self, data, pre=False, post=False)`
- Current lynguine: `run_all(self, data, interface)`

Additionally, the behavior of `run_all` is different than originally assumed:
- It iterates through all indices in the data frame
- For each index, it calls `run(data, interface)`
- The number of times `run` is called depends on the number of indices in the data frame, not the number of compute items

This explains why our test was failing - we were expecting `run` to be called based on the number of compute items, but it's actually called based on the number of indices in the data frame.

### Proposed Fix for `test_run_all`
The current test:
```python
def test_run_all(compute_instance, mocker, mock_data, mock_interface):
    mocker.patch.object(compute_instance, 'run', return_value=None)
    mocker.patch.object(compute_instance, '_computes', {'precompute': [], 'compute': [], 'postcompute': []})
    compute_instance.run_all(mock_data, mock_interface)
    # Assert run_all functionality
```

Should be updated to:
```python
def test_run_all(compute_instance, mocker, mock_data_with_indices, mock_interface):
    # Setup mocks
    run_mock = mocker.patch.object(compute_instance, 'run', return_value=None)
    mocker.patch.object(compute_instance, '_computes', {'precompute': [], 'compute': [], 'postcompute': []})
    
    # Call the method being tested with a DataFrame that has indices
    compute_instance.run_all(mock_data_with_indices, mock_interface)
    
    # The run_all method should call run once for each index in the DataFrame
    # Our mock_data_with_indices has 2 indices
    assert run_mock.call_count == 2
    
    # Reset the mock
    run_mock.reset_mock()
    
    # Test with non-empty compute lists - doesn't affect call count since it's based on indices
    mocker.patch.object(compute_instance, '_computes', {
        'precompute': [{'name': 'pre1'}], 
        'compute': [{'name': 'comp1'}, {'name': 'comp2'}], 
        'postcompute': [{'name': 'post1'}]
    })
    
    # Call run_all again
    compute_instance.run_all(mock_data_with_indices, mock_interface)
    
    # Should still be called twice (once per index), regardless of compute items
    assert run_mock.call_count == 2
    
    # Verify the method calls
    expected_calls = [
        mocker.call(mock_data_with_indices, mock_interface),
        mocker.call(mock_data_with_indices, mock_interface)
    ]
    run_mock.assert_has_calls(expected_calls)
```

We also need to add a fixture to create test data with indices:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_data_with_indices(mocker):
    # Create a DataFrame with two indices for testing run_all
    df = pd.DataFrame({'col1': [1, 2], 'col2': ['a', 'b']})
    return CustomDataFrame(df)
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Standardize Test Methods**:
   - Update all test methods to reflect the current lynguine implementation signatures
   - Add appropriate assertions to verify the behavior of these methods
   - Document the expected parameter signature for each method

2. **Improve Documentation of Inheritance**:
   - Add comments in tests explaining which methods are inherited from lynguine
   - Ensure tests reflect the correct understanding of the inheritance structure

3. **Ensure Proper Mocking**:
   - Review all mocks to ensure they properly reflect the lynguine implementation
   - Update mock objects to match the current method signatures

4. **Add Method Signature Validation**:
   - Add tests that verify method signatures match between parent and child classes
   - Provide clear error messages when signatures don't match

## Backward Compatibility
This CIP aims to improve code quality without changing external interfaces. All changes should be transparent to users of the library and only affect the test suite.

## Testing Strategy
- Update existing tests to ensure they pass with the lynguine implementation
- Add new tests specifically targeting the inheritance relationship
- Document test cases for methods with changed signatures

## Implementation Status
- [x] Fix the failing `test_run_all` method
- [x] Update the test to reflect the correct understanding of run_all behavior
- [x] Standardize other test methods in test_assess_compute.py
- [x] Improve basic documentation of inheritance in tests
- [x] Ensure proper mocking for test_run_all
- [ ] Add method signature validation
- [ ] Validate changes across all tests
- [ ] More comprehensive documentation improvements will be addressed in CIP-0003
