# CIP-0003: Comprehensive Documentation Standardization and Sphinx Integration

## Status
Implemented

## Summary
This CIP proposes a comprehensive approach to standardizing documentation across the referia codebase, with particular focus on documenting inheritance relationships with lynguine and integrating with lynguine's Sphinx documentation system.

## Motivation
The referia codebase heavily inherits functionality from lynguine, but the documentation does not consistently reflect this relationship. Developers often have to examine both codebases to understand how methods are inherited, extended, or overridden. Standardizing documentation and integrating with lynguine's Sphinx system would:

1. Make inheritance relationships explicitly clear throughout the codebase
2. Ensure consistent documentation standards across all modules
3. Allow developers to easily understand which functionality comes from lynguine vs. referia
4. Provide a unified documentation experience that builds on lynguine's existing documentation
5. Reduce duplication of documentation effort for inherited functionality

## Description
This CIP will establish standardized documentation practices across the referia codebase by:

1. **Documenting Inheritance Relationships**:
   - Clearly indicate when a class inherits from lynguine
   - Document which methods are inherited, overridden, or newly introduced
   - Provide references to parent class documentation where appropriate

2. **Standardizing Docstring Format**:
   - Adopt the same Sphinx-compatible format as lynguine (using reStructuredText format)
   - Use consistent parameter documentation with `:param name:` and `:type name:` format
   - Document return values with `:return:` and `:rtype:` format
   - Include class and method descriptions that explain functionality

3. **Sphinx Documentation Integration**:
   - Set up Sphinx documentation system compatible with lynguine
   - Create parallel structure to lynguine's documentation (modules, examples, etc.)
   - Cross-reference lynguine documentation for inherited functionality
   - Generate comprehensive API documentation that clearly shows inheritance

4. **Test Documentation**:
   - Continue the work already begun in standardizing test method documentation
   - Ensure test docstrings clearly explain what aspects of functionality are being tested
   - Document testing strategies for inherited vs. extended functionality

## Implementation
The implementation will proceed in several phases:

1. **Documentation Audit**:
   - Compare existing referia documentation with lynguine Sphinx documentation
   - Identify gaps and inconsistencies in docstring formats
   - Create an inventory of classes and methods requiring documentation updates

2. **Docstring Standardization**:
   - Update all docstrings to follow lynguine's format:
     ```python
     def method(self, param1, param2):
         """
         Short description of method.

         Longer description if needed.

         :param param1: Description of parameter 1
         :type param1: type of parameter 1
         :param param2: Description of parameter 2
         :type param2: type of parameter 2
         :return: Description of return value
         :rtype: return type
         :raises ExceptionClass: When exception is raised
         """
     ```
   - Clearly indicate inheritance in class docstrings:
     ```python
     class SubClass(lynguine.ParentClass):
         """
         SubClass extends lynguine.ParentClass with additional functionality.

         This class inherits core methods X, Y, Z from the parent class and
         adds/overrides methods A, B, C.

         See lynguine.ParentClass for inherited functionality.
         """
     ```

3. **Sphinx Integration**:
   - Set up similar Sphinx structure as lynguine with modules divided by functionality
   - Create .rst files that mirror lynguine's documentation structure
   - Use the automodule directives with :show-inheritance: flag to highlight inheritance

4. **Test Documentation**:
   - Apply standardized test documentation to all test files
   - Update test docstrings to clearly explain testing strategies
   - Document expected behavior for inherited functionality

## Backward Compatibility
These changes are purely documentation-related and do not affect the functionality of the codebase. There are no backward compatibility concerns.

## Test Plan
The documentation improvements can be verified by:

1. Building the Sphinx documentation and ensuring it generates without errors
2. Validating that the generated documentation accurately reflects inheritance relationships
3. Verifying cross-references to lynguine documentation work correctly
4. Checking that all public APIs are properly documented

## Discussion
Improving documentation is a crucial step in making the referia codebase more maintainable and easier for new developers to understand. The strong inheritance relationship with lynguine makes this particularly important, as developers need to understand which functionality comes from which codebase.

The approach of integrating with Sphinx and cross-referencing lynguine documentation will provide a unified documentation experience while minimizing duplication of effort.

Examining lynguine's documentation (/Users/neil/lawrennd/lynguine/docs/), we found that it uses:
1. A structured Sphinx format with modules divided by functionality
2. reStructuredText format in docstrings
3. Clear parameter and return value documentation
4. Class-level docstrings that explain the purpose and functionality

By adopting the same conventions, we'll ensure consistency across the two codebases and make it easier for developers to move between them.
